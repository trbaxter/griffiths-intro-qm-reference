\underline{\textbf{Practice Q5:}} \ \textbf{What is the median age?}

\bigskip

\underline{Solution}

First off - ensure that the values are sorted from least to greatest.

For such a small dataset, it may be temping to cross-out values one-by-one on
both ends, but there's a superior way.

When the number of elements N is even, the median is the average of the elements
in the $\dfrac{N}{2}$ and $\dfrac{(N+1)}{2}$ positions. When the number of
elements is odd, the median is simply the element in the $\dfrac{N}{2}$
position.

\[
    \Rightarrow \dfrac{22+24}{2} = \boxed{23}
\]
