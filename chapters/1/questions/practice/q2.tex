\underline{\textbf{Practice Q2:}} \ \textbf{From the previous question, what is the probability of selecting someone
age 14 or someone age 15 from the room?}

\bigskip

\underline{Solution}

The probability of selecting someone who's 14 or 15 can be symbolically represented by the following:

\[
    P(14 \ \text{or} \ 15) = P(14 \cup 15)
\]

Because this scenario is a mutually exclusive selection (someone can't be both
14 \textit{\textbf{\underline{and}}} 15 at the same time), this can be expressed
equivalently as:

\begin{align*}
    P(14 \, \text{or} \, 15) &= P(14) + P(15) \\[1.5ex]
    &= \dfrac{1}{14} + \dfrac{1}{14} \\[1.5ex]
    &= \dfrac{2}{14} \\[1.5ex]
    &= \boxed{\dfrac{1}{7}}
\end{align*}

Note that we took advantage of the following for this solution:

\[
    P(A \ \cup \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ \cap \ B)
\]


Where, as we pointed out:

\[
    P(A \ \cap \ B) = 0
\]
