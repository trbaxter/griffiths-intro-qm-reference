What's the physical meaning behind Planck's constant? \ What is it telling us?

Answer:

Planck's constant can be thought of in a couple different ways:

1.) It's like the scaling factor for quantum behavior.

When the action (\textit{E} $\cdot$ \textit{t} or
\textit{p} $\cdot$ \textit{x}) $\gg$ \textit{h},
then quantum effects are negligible and vice versa.

2.) It sets the smallest scale at which action makes a difference.

3.) It tells you how finely you can divide energy-time or position-momentum
before classical intuition begins to break down.

4.) It can be thought of as something akin to the `pixel size' of the universe.
