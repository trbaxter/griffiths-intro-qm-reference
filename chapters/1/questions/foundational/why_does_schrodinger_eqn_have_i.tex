We're given the form for the Schr√∂dinger wave equation, but we're never told
how such an expression containing the imaginary value \textit{i} can predict
behavior in the real world. How can that even work?

Reason:

In quantum mechanics, particles interfere not just based on magnitude, but also
on relative phase. \ Using \textit{i} allows us to track that.
Additionally, efforts were made to craft a formalism without using
imaginary numbers. \ Unfortunately, nothing worked. \ Necessity
\underline{requires} their usage. \ Especially in regards to probability
calculations.
