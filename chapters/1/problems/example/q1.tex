\textbf{\underline{Example 1}}

A rock is dropped off a cliff of height $h$. As it falls, we snap a million photographs at random intervals.
On each picture, we measure the distance the rock has fallen. What is the average of all these distances? In other
words, what is the time average of the distance traveled?

Since the rock is dropped from rest, the distance it falls at some time $t$ is given by:

\[
  y(t) = \frac{1}{2}gt^{2}
\]

The time it takes to fall the full height, $h$, is:

\[
  h = \frac{1}{2}gT^{2}
\]

Solving for the total fall time, $T$:

\begin{align*}
  2h &= gT^{2} \\[1.5ex]
  \frac{2h}{g} &= T^{2} \\[1.5ex]
  \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} &= T
\end{align*}

The time average of the distance traveled by the rock, represented by $y(t)$, is just
$\langle \, y \, \rangle$ divided by the total time, $T$:

\begin{align*}
  \langle \, y \, \rangle &= \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} y(t) \, dt \\[1.5ex]
  &= \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} \frac{1}{2}gt^{2} \, dt \\[1.5ex]
  &= \frac{g}{2T} \int_{0}^{T} t^{2} \, dt \\[1.5ex]
  &= \frac{g}{2T} \Bigg[ \frac{t^{3}}{3} \Bigg] \Bigg|_{0}^{T}
\end{align*}

\newpage

\begin{align*}
  &= \frac{gT^{3}}{6T} \\[1.5ex]
  &= \frac{gT^{2}}{6}
\end{align*}

Rewriting in terms of known quantities:

\begin{align*}
  &= \frac{g \Big(\sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \, \Big)^{2}}{6} \\[1.5ex]
  &= \frac{2h}{6} \\[1.5ex]
  \therefore \: \langle \, y \, \rangle &= \boxed{\frac{h}{3}}
\end{align*}

\bigskip

The result agrees with Griffith's statements about the rock spending more time near the top of the fall and how the
result must be less than \textit{h}/2.

\textbf{\underline{The big idea}}

Probability is not always uniform across space; it depends on how much ``time'' a system spends in a given
configuration.

\smallskip

\textbf{\underline{A deeper look}}

The problem illustrates the differences in \textit{time vs. space sampling}.

A uniform sampling of distance for the rock would result in an average distance of \textit{h}/2. \newline But this
problem samples through \textit{time}, which is not uniformly distributed through space.
