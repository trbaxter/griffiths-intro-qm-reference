\textbf{\underline{Example 1}}

A rock is dropped off a cliff of height $h$. As it falls, we snap a million photographs at random intervals.
On each picture, we measure the distance the rock has fallen. What is the average of all these distances? In other
words, what is the time average of the distance traveled?
