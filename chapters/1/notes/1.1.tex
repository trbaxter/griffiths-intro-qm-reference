Classical mechanics approach to particles:

Determine \textit{x(t)} from $F = \dot{p}$ and initial conditions.

\bigskip \bigskip

Quantum approach:

Determine $\Psi(x,t)$ from $i\hbar \, \partial_{t}(\Psi) =
- \dfrac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \, \partial_{x}^{2}(\Psi)
+ V\Psi$

This implies that the Schr√∂dinger equation serves as something akin to the \\
`Newton's 2$^{\text{nd}}$ Law' in quantum mechanics.

Born's statistical interpretation of the wave function is given by the
following:

\[
    \int_{a}^{b} |\Psi|^{2} \, \text{d}x
\]

Which produces the probability of finding an object between points
\textit{a} and \textit{b} at time \textit{t}.
